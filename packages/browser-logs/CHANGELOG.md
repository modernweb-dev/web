### Patch Changes

- aa65fd1: run build before publishing

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9be1f95: Added native node es module entrypoints. This is a breaking change. Before, native node es module imports would import a CJS module as a default import and require destructuring afterwards:

  ```js
  import playwrightModule from '@web/test-runner-playwright';

  const { playwrightLauncher } = playwrightModule;
  ```

  Now, the exports are only available directly as a named export:

  ```js
  import { playwrightLauncher } from '@web/test-runner-playwright';
  ```

## 0.0.1
