# Web Test Runner Core

Core package for Web Test Runner. Manages running the tests. Has a modular architecture, delegating most of the work to the separate parts and implementations.

See [@web/test-runner](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner) for a default implementation and CLI for the test runner.

## Browser launchers

Browser launchers boot up and control a browser instance. Implementations:

- [@web/test-runner-chrome](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-chrome)
- [@web/test-runner-puppeteer](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-puppeteer)
- [@web/test-runner-playwright](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-playwright)
- `@web/test-runner-selenium` (coming soon)
- `@web/test-runner-browserstack` (coming soon)

[Read more here](./docs/browser-launcher.md) to learn about creating your own browser launcher.

## Test frameworks

Test frameworks run the actual tests in the browser. Web test runner relies on existing test frameworks. Implementations:

- [@web/test-runner-mocha](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-mocha)

[Read more here](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-browser-lib) to learn more about using the browser library without a testing framework, or to implement your own testing framework.

## Servers

The server serves the test code and files and communicates with the browser, returning configuration and receiving test results. Implementations:

- [@web/test-runner-server](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-server)

[Read more here](./docs/dev-server.md) to learn about creating your own test runner server.
