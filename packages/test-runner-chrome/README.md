# Web Test Runner Chrome

Browser launcher for web test runner. Looks for a locally installed instance of Chrome, and controls it using [puppeteer-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core). This avoids the postinstall step of `puppeteer` or `playwright`, speeding up installation of projects.

See [our website](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/browser-launchers/chrome/) for full documentation.
