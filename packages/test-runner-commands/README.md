# Test Runner Commands

Commands for executing code server-side during your tests in the browser. To control the browser page, access the file system, or execute NodeJS libraries.

Built-in commands can change the viewport, emulate media queries or set the user agent. You can create custom commands to implement your own functionalities.

See [our website](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/commands/) for full documentation.
