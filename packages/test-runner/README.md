# Web Test Runner

> This project is in beta. We are looking for people to test it out, and let us know about issues and what they think about it.

A test runner for web applications.

üëâ Headless testing on real browsers with puppeteer, playwright, or selenium.
\
üîß Write tests and configuration using native es modules.
\
üîç Runs tests in parallel and isolation
\
üëÄ Interactive watch mode, rerunning only changed tests.
\
üöß Reports logs, 404s, and errors that happen in the browser.

## Getting started

Install the test runner:

```bash
npm i -D @web/test-runner
```

Do a single test run:

```bash
wtr test/**/*.test.js
```

Run in watch mode, reloading on file changes:

```bash
wtr test/**/*.test.js --watch
```

Run with test coverage:

```bash
wtr test/**/*.test.js --coverage
```

### Writing tests

Web test runner can support different test frameworks. By default we use [@web/test-runner-mocha](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-mocha), check out the docs to learn more about authoring tests.

### Browsers

By default tests are run with the locally installed instance of Chrome.

#### Puppeteer

You can run tests with puppeteer, which will download it's own instance of Chromium instead of relying on a globally installed version of Chrome.

```bash
# add the package
npm i -D @web/test-runner-puppeteer

# add the flag
wtr test/**/*.test.js --puppeteer
```

#### Playwright

You can run tests with playwright, which like puppeteer downloads it's own browsers. Playwright allows testing on chromium, firefox and webkit.

```bash
# add the package
npm i -D @web/test-runner-playwright

# add the flag
wtr test/**/*.test.js --playwright --browsers chromium firefox webkit
```

## Configuration

Web test runner looks for a configuration file in the current working directory called `web-test-runner.config`.

The file extension can be `.js`, `.cjs` or `.mjs`. A `.js` file will be loaded as an es module or common js module based on the node js package type of your project.

```js
export default {
  concurrency: 10,
  watch: true,
  coverage: {
    threshold: {
      statements: 70,

      functions: 70,
      lines: 70,
    },
  },
};
```

  functions: number;

}

export interface CoverageConfig {
  include?: string[];
  exclude?: string[];
  threshold?: CoverageThresholdConfig;
}

export interface TestRunnerConfig {
  files: string | string[];
  testFrameworkImport: string;
  browsers: BrowserLauncher | BrowserLauncher[];

  devServer: EsDevServerConfig;
  address: string;
  port: number;
  testRunnerHtml?: (config: TestRunnerConfig) => string;
  watch?: boolean;
  coverage?: boolean | CoverageConfig;
  concurrency?: number;
  browserStartTimeout?: number;
  sessionStartTimeout?: number;
  sessionFinishTimeout?: number;
  staticLogging?: boolean;
}
```

### Server and code transformation

This package uses [@web/test-runner-dev-server](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-dev-server). You can configure the dev server from the config:

  <summary>View example</summary>

```js
export default {
  devServer: {
    rootDir: '../..',
    middlewares: [],
    plugins: [],
  },
};
```

</details>

es-dev-server has an extensive configuration and plugin system, check out the docs for all options.

## Advanced customization

This package is opinionated, and implements defaults so that people can get started without much configuration.

For more advanced configuration you can use the individual packages this project is based on. See [@web/test-runner-core](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-core) and [@web/test-runner-cli](https://github.com/modernweb-dev/web/tree/master/packages/test-runner-core) to learn more about that.
