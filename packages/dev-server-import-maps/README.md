# Dev server import maps

Plugin for resolving imports using [Import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps).

Import Maps can be used to resolve imports in your code as an alternative to the `--node-resolve` flag, or to mock modules.

See [our website](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/plugins/import-maps/) for full documentation.
