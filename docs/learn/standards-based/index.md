<!-- TODO -->

- There are many ways to make websites and apps
- The web platform itself provides a robust environment for app development
- Various abstractions over the web platform have become popular in recent years, often requiring "build steps" to transform authored code into platform primitives like HTML, CSS, and JS
  - for example, JSX and Svelte offer HTML-like syntaxes for authoring components, but neither syntax can actually run in a browser, without first being transformed by a build step
- We advocate for a standards-based approach in which the platform is used to the fullest, before reaching for those abstractions
