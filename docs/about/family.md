The goal of `Modern Web` is to bring developers and the browser back on the same table.
It's a powerful symbiosis that got a little lost in the framework churn.

The `Modern Web` is very powerful even without any abstraction and we wanna show how.

The Modern Web Family consists of

- [modern-web.dev](https://modern-web.dev) with the `@web` npm namespace
- [open-wc.org](https://open-wc.org) with the `@open-wc` npm namespace
