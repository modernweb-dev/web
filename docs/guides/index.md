So you want to learn how to develop the modern web?
We've gathered a selected group of practices and tutorials to help guide you on your course.
Welcome! üëã

If you're just beginning you journey into web development, we hope you'll come to enjoy it as much
as we do.
If you've already established yourself but want to see what a standards-based approach to web dev can
offer, we think you'll be surprised how far the in-built web's capabilities have evolved.

## Web Development

Over the last several years, web development has become almost synonymous with web _framework_ development.
Indeed, the proliferation and popularity of front-end web frameworks has lead many in
the industry know more about their framework of choice than they do about the underlying platform.

We feel the best way to become a well-rounded and highly-capable web developer is to focus first on
learning what the web platform has to offer with as few frameworks and tools added on top as possible.
In other words, we think your goal should be to become a _web_ developer first, and only incidentally
a _framework_ developer.

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) is an excellent resource for learning web APIs and practices.
We recommend [MDN's Getting started with the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/guides/Getting_started_with_the_web) as the foundation of any web development curriculum.

To that, we'd like to add some choice notes from our collective decades in the industry.

- [Servers and Clients](./standards-based/servers-and-clients.md)
- [HTML](./standards-based/html.md)
- [CSS](./standards-based/css.md)
- [JavaScript](./standards-based/javascript.md)
- [ES Modules](./standards-based/es-modules.md)
- [Components](./standards-based/components.md)

## Web Test Runner

Testing your code is very important to have the confidence to release often.
Green tests should mean that the change is good to go üëç
