This section is dedicated in helping you to get confident in our modern web way of working.

## Going Buildless

Modern browsers have come a long way, and today are a powerful platform for building websites and applications. Our goal is to work with what's available in the browser first before reaching for custom solutions.

In this section we'd like to show you some buildless approaches and workflows, that might allow you to replace some of your tooling with built-in browser functionalities.

Testing your code is important to have the confidence to release often. When all your tests are passing, that means you're good to go!
