Modern browsers are a powerful platform for building websites and applications. Our goal is to work with what's available in the browser first before reaching for custom solutions.

When you're working _with_ the browser rather than against it, code, skills, and knowledge remain relevant for a longer time. Development becomes faster and debugger easier because there are fewer layers of abstractions involved.

There is a lot of great documentation out there to help you get started with web development. On our website we try to fill gaps, documenting features and concepts not covered elsewhere.
