Modern browsers have come a long way, and today are a powerful platform for building websites and applications. Our goal is to work with what's available in the browser first before reaching for custom solutions. 

In this section we'd like to show you some **buildless** approaches and workflows, that might allow you to replace some of your tooling with built-in browser functionalities.

When you're working _with_ the browser rather than against it, code, skills, and knowledge remain relevant for a longer time. Development becomes faster and debugging easier because there are fewer layers of abstractions involved.
