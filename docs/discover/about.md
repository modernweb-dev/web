The goal of `Modern Web` is to bring developers and the browser back on the same table.

By providing tools, libraries, and guides we help developers write code for the web, working closely with the browser and creating as few abstractions as possible.

The Modern Web Family consists of:

- [modern-web.dev](https://modern-web.dev) with the `@web` npm namespace
- [open-wc.org](https://open-wc.org) with the `@open-wc` npm namespace
