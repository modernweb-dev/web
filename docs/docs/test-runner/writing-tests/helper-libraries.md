# Test Runner >> Writing Tests >> Helper Libraries ||30

Not all helper libraries ship es modules which are usable in the browser. On this page we collect libraries which are available as es modules. If need to use a library with another module format, you can follow the instructions at the bottom of the [es modules page](../../../guides/going-buildless/es-modules.md)

## General libraries

[@open-wc/testing](https://open-wc.org/testing/testing.html) is a general-purpose library, including assertions via chai, HTML test fixtures, a11y tests, and test helpers. It is an opinionated implementation that brings together multiple libraries.

## Assertions

[chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) is a popular assertion library. It doesn't ship an es module, but you can use [@esm-bundle/chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@esm-bundle/chai) for that.

```js
import { expect } from '@esm-bundle/chai';

expect(undefined).to.not.be.a('function');
```

## Chai plugins

- [@open-wc/chai-dom-equals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-wc/chai-dom-equals) for diffing HTML
- [chai-a11y-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai-a11y-axe) for testing accessibility

## Testing helpers

[@open-wc/testing-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-wc/testing-helpers) contains useful helper functions for setting up snippets of HTML test fixtures, and testing async behavior

## Mocking

For stubbing and mocking, we recommend [sinon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon). Check the [mocking page](./mocking.md) for more.
