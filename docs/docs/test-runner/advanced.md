The test runner has a modular architecture, with the `@web/test-runner` package implemented an opinionated set of defaults.

It's possible to piece together your own test runner using the individual parts, integrating it with other libraries and systems.

We don't have any documentation on this right now, get in touch if this is something you are looking to do.
