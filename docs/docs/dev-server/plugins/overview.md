# Dev Server >> Plugins >> Overview ||1

The Web Dev Server comes with a few plugins out of the box.

See

- [esbuild](./esbuild.md)
- [rollup](./rollup.md)
- [import-maps](./import-maps.md)
- [legacy](./legacy.md)

If you have more specific needs it's best to [write your own plugin](../writing-plugins/overview.md).
