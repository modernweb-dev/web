## Guiding Principles

### Low barrier to entry

We provide tooling that is easy to get into and requires as little prerequisite knowledge as possible. No longer do you need a degree in Webpack to deploy an application.

### Performant

Both from a speed and size perspective, we focus on tooling that helps create performant products and services.

### Close to the platform

Following platform will ensure that your knowledge and skills learnt, remain relevant over time. Frameworks may come and go, but the platform stays.
This means that we value platform solutions over tooling that goes into the opposite direcction.
